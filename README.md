- Highlighting the line currently being edited
- Automatic indentation
- Many undo/redo levels
- Search/Replace functionality
- Etc. etc.

Requirements
------------

If you already have codemirror used in your project, you can configure the codemirror path in your configuration, see bellow.
If you don't have codemirror, you need to add it as submodule like this:

1. cd into your tiny_mce directory, which contains folders like: classes, langs, plugins, skins ans themes
2. open terminal and run: git submodule add https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror.git plugins/codemirror/codemirror
3. cd into plugins/codemirror/codemirror
4. run command: sudo npm install
5. run command: npm run-script prepublish

Installation
------------

1. Download and install TinyMCE 4 or TinyMCE 5 (>= 5.0.4) and make sure it runs correctly with default settings.
2. Download this repository found at https://github.com/christiaan/tinymce-codemirror
3. Place the directory `plugins/codemirror` in the `tinymce/plugins` directory.
4. Download CodeMirror (version 4 or later) from http://codemirror.net/codemirror-latest.zip.
5. Unpack codemirror-latest.zip inside the plugins/codemirror folder that was
   just created. A folder named codemirror-4.8 (or similar) will be created.
6. Activate the codemirror plugin in TinyMCE:

    plugins: ['codemirror']

7. Optionally, add the code button to TinyMCEâ€™s toolbar:

    toolbar: 'undo redo | styleselect | bold italic | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | code'

8. Test: You should see a Source code item in the Tools menu. Click it to edit
   the HTML source code.

Configuration
-------------
Additional configuration options

You can modify the behaviour of the codemirror plugin, by adding a codemirror
object to the TinyMCE configuration.

**indentOnInit**: boolean (false) CodeMirror automatically indents code. With
the indentOnInit option, you tell the Source Code editor to indent all code when
the editor opens. This might be slow for large documents.

**fullscreen** boolean (false) Whether to load the tinymce plugin and codemirror
in full screen mode.

**width**: int (800) Codemirror window width

**height**: int (550) Codemirror window height

**saveCursorPosition**: boolean (true) Insert caret marker

**path**: string (codemirror) You might already have CodeMirror hosted elsewhere
(outside TinyMCE). In that case, you can reuse that CodeMirror instance, by
overriding the default path. For example:

    path: 'http://www.mysite.com/tools/codemirror-x.y'

**config**: Object CodeMirror configuration object, which is passed on to the
CodeMirror instance. Check http://codemirror.net/doc/manual.html for available
configuration options.

**disableFilesMerge**: When set to true, disables default set of jsFiles and cssFiles.
This is usable when you have custom prebuilt codemirror, that can be passed to
jsFiles and cssFiles. For example:

    path: '/assets/js/codemirror/',
    disableFilesMerge: true,
    jsFiles: [
       'codemirror.custom.min.js'
    ],
    cssFiles: [
       'codemirror.custom.min.css'
    ]

**jsFiles**: Array Array of CodeMirror Javascript files you want to
(additionally) load. For example:

    jsFiles: [
       'mode/clike/clike.js',
       'mode/php/php.js'
    ]

The following Javascript files are always loaded: lib/codemirror.js,
addon/edit/matchbrackets.js, mode/xml/xml.js, mode/javascript/javascript.js,
mode/css/css.js, mode/htmlmixed/htmlmixed.js, addon/dialog/dialog.js,
addon/search/searchcursor.js, addon/search/search.js,
addon/selection/active-line.js.


**cssFiles**: Array Array of CodeMirror CSS files you want to (additionally)
load. For example:

    cssFiles: [
       'theme/neat.css',
       'theme/elegant.css'
    ]

The following CSS files are always loaded: lib/codemirror.css,
addon/dialog/dialog.css.

Config example

```js
tinymce.init({
  selector: '#html',
  plugins: 'codemirror',
  toolbar: 'undo redo | styleselect | bold italic | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | code',
  codemirror: {
    indentOnInit: true, // Whether or not to indent code on init.
    fullscreen: true,   // Default setting is false
    path: 'CodeMirror', // Path to CodeMirror distribution
    config: {           // CodeMirror config object
       mode: 'application/x-httpd-php',
       lineNumbers: false
    },
    width: 800,         // Default value is 800
    height: 600,        // Default value is 550
    saveCursorPosition: true,    // Insert caret marker
    jsFiles: [          // Additional JS files to load
       'mode/clike/clike.js',
       'mode/php/php.js'
    ]
  }
});
```

Compatibility
-------------

This TinyMCE plugin is compatible with pretty much all browsers out there,
including Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer, version 8 or
better. It is NOT compatible with Interner Explorer 6 or 7, simply because
CodeMirror itself does not work in these versions.
